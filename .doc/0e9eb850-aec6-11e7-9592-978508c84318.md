# Overview

This project has the objective to deploy a system to allow the management of such resources by the administrative team and the workflow associated to their creation/translation/review/publication, as well as the access of these media resources by the different systems via APIs. It will also perform the transcoding of media files as necessary, generate some basic reports and export data in a predefined format for consumption of a media crawler internal to Tuningfork.

For an understanding of the high-level architecture to support this please refer to the [Architecture](d6d68f40-aec7-11e7-894f-6b718994da22.md) section.
